# Runtime State and Config Paths

- Store all runtime artifacts and user config **outside** the git repository.
- Use `~/.omniclaw` as the default state root for new code.
- Never introduce new default writes under repo-local paths like `./data`, `./memory`, or workspace root internals.
- Prefer existing helpers (`resolveStateDir`, `resolveConfigPath`, related path utilities) instead of hardcoding state paths.

## When Adding New Files or Caches

- Put them under `OMNICLAW_STATE_DIR` (or its resolved default `~/.omniclaw`).
- Ensure parent directories are created safely (`mkdir` with recursive mode) before writing.
- Keep user-facing help text and docs aligned with `~/.omniclaw`.
